#To-do-List-Program-using-HTML-CSS-JS This is a school assignment that I made to create a program that can help me carry out daily activities and find out what activities I have done and what I will do.

# How this program works ?
- The first step is for you to enter what activities you want to do today
- If you have done this activity, you can click on the black circle to the left of the activity box
- And if you want to delete it, you just need to press the red button to the right of the activity box
